description: A Mac menubar app for ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I made this menubar app in 2015.

The bulk of the app operates based off of [~40 lines of (mediocre) code](https://github.com/nickbytes/shrug/blob/master/main.js).

Its purpose?

Copy the `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` to your clipboard using a hotkey (`Ctrl + Option + \`) or by clicking the icon in the menubar.

I still use this app a few times a week, and always install it on new machines.

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
